"""Ledoit-Wolf studentized bootstrap for the confirmed_2d-minus-fixed-JM Sharpe.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The 2026-08-09 L4 verification reported a *plain percentile* moving-block
bootstrap interval for the paired Sharpe difference (63-day blocks, 2000
replicates, `np.percentile(deltas, [2.5, 97.5])`). That is the shortcut, not
the method. For exactly this problem -- the difference of two Sharpe ratios on
heavy-tailed, serially dependent, paired return series -- Ledoit and Wolf
(2008) recommend a *studentized* time series bootstrap, because the plain
percentile interval inherits the first-order error of the raw sampling
distribution while the studentized ("bootstrap-t") interval is second-order
accurate for a smooth function of means. This script implements their
procedure and reports it beside the shortcut so the two can be compared.

FRAMING (owner instruction, 2026-08-09)
---------------------------------------
Resampling evidence is a *secondary descriptive diagnostic* in this project's
evaluation hierarchy (`da-jm-evaluation-hierarchy-2026-08-09`). Neither
interval here is a pass/fail gate. "Contains zero" is not a verdict that the
effect is absent, and "excludes zero" would not be a verdict that it is real.
The output describes conditional return-sampling uncertainty for one frozen
decision path, nothing more; the four limitations recorded in
`docs/audit/2026-08-09-optimizer-fidelity-l4-receipt.md` (data snooping,
conditioning on a fixed fitted path, stationarity, wrong unit of analysis)
apply unchanged to the studentized interval. State the fourth precisely: a
block bootstrap does NOT treat the ~8,500 daily observations as independent
draws -- blocking exists to avoid exactly that. The limitation is in the
estimand, not the resampler. The daily-return Sharpe difference is dominated by
only tens of transition-related observations, which is why the episode-level
analysis (`scripts/diagnostics/probe_confirmed2d_episodes.py`) is the more
mechanism-relevant unit of analysis for this challenger.

WHAT IS IMPLEMENTED
-------------------
(a) Delta-method / HAC standard error.  Ledoit-Wolf work with uncentered
    second moments so that the Sharpe difference is a smooth function of a
    vector of means.  Their Eqs. (1)-(2): with v = (mu_1, mu_2, ga_1, ga_2)',
    ga_i = E[r_i^2],

        Delta = f(v),   f(a, b, c, d) = a / sqrt(c - a^2) - b / sqrt(d - b^2)

    and their Eq. (4) gradient

        grad f(a,b,c,d) = ( c / (c-a^2)^1.5,
                           -d / (d-b^2)^1.5,
                     -(1/2) a / (c-a^2)^1.5,
                     +(1/2) b / (d-b^2)^1.5 ).

    (The published gradient's fourth entry is POSITIVE; the widely mirrored
    Python port `majkee15/RobustSharpeRatioHAC` has it negative, which is a
    transcription bug -- d/dd of -b(d-b^2)^-0.5 is +b/2(d-b^2)^-1.5. This
    script follows the paper.)

    Then Eq. (5): s(Delta_hat) = sqrt( grad f(v_hat)' Psi_hat grad f(v_hat) / T ),
    with Psi_hat the HAC kernel estimate of the long-run covariance of the
    moment process y_t = (r_1t - mu_1, r_2t - mu_2, r_1t^2 - ga_1, r_2t^2 - ga_2)',
    Psi_hat = T/(T-p) * sum_j k(j / S_T) Gamma_hat(j).  Following Ledoit-Wolf
    Section 3.1 and their footnote 8 we use the PREWHITENED PARZEN kernel:
    VAR(1) prewhitening of Andrews and Monahan (1992) with spectral-radius
    capping, Parzen kernel, automatic bandwidth S_T = 2.6614 (alpha(2) T)^(1/5)
    of Andrews (1991) computed on the prewhitened residuals, then recoloring.
    Footnote 8 states the prewhitened Parzen kernel performs very similarly to
    the prewhitened QS kernel they report; Parzen has finite support and is
    more convenient.

    THIS PROJECT'S SHARPE IS NOT LEDOIT-WOLF'S.  `annualized_excess_sharpe`
    uses sqrt(252) * mean(strategy - cash) / sd(strategy): the numerator nets
    out a *stochastic* cash leg, the denominator does not.  The 4-dimensional
    moment vector is therefore extended to the 5-dimensional

        v = (m_1, m_2, g_1, g_2, k),  m_i = E[s_i], g_i = E[s_i^2], k = E[cash]

    with sig_i^2 = g_i - m_i^2 and

        Delta = sqrt(A) [ (m_1 - k)/sig_1 - (m_2 - k)/sig_2 ],

    whose gradient (derived in `_gradient_repo`, verified against a finite
    difference in `main`) is

        d/dm_1 = +sqrt(A) (g_1 - m_1 k) / sig_1^3
        d/dm_2 = -sqrt(A) (g_2 - m_2 k) / sig_2^3
        d/dg_1 = -sqrt(A) (m_1 - k) / (2 sig_1^3)
        d/dg_2 = +sqrt(A) (m_2 - k) / (2 sig_2^3)
        d/dk   =  sqrt(A) (1/sig_2 - 1/sig_1).

    Setting k == 0 and A == 1 collapses this onto Ledoit-Wolf Eq. (4) up to the
    Bessel constant below, so the extension is a strict generalization of their
    function, not a different method.  The canonical 4-moment Ledoit-Wolf
    estimator on excess returns is ALSO run, as a cross-check that the
    extension is not doing the work.

    ddof=1, NOT ddof=0 (correction, 2026-08-09).  A moment vector of uncentered
    moments yields the POPULATION standard deviation sqrt(g - m^2), whereas
    `performance_metrics`/`annualized_excess_sharpe` divide by
    `Series.std(ddof=1)`.  Written as it was first, this script therefore
    estimated a slightly different quantity from the one every other number in
    this repository reports -- small (a relative gap of 1/(2T) ~ 6e-5 at
    T ~ 8,500) but a different estimand, and "asymptotically equivalent" is not
    the standard this repo applies to a headline comparator.  Because
    (1/(T-1)) sum (r - m)^2 = (T/(T-1)) (g - m^2), the Bessel correction enters
    the Sharpe difference as the single multiplicative constant

        ddof_scale(T) = sqrt((T - 1) / T),

    applied to Delta and hence to its gradient.  The repo estimator now equals
    `performance_metrics`' Sharpe difference exactly (asserted in `main` to
    1e-12, and in `tests/test_studentized_sharpe_difference.py`).

    The factor is applied to the `repo` estimator ONLY (correction, 2026-08-09,
    owner-caught in review).  It was first applied to both, which was wrong:
    `lw_excess` uses the Ledoit-Wolf Eq. (1)-(2) FUNCTIONAL FORM, with this
    repo's annualization factor sqrt(252) applied afterwards for reporting
    (their Eq. (1)-(2) is unannualized, so "verbatim" would be too strong).
    Its denominators ARE the population sds implied by the uncentered moments,
    and Eq. (4) is the gradient of that functional form.  Rescaling it by the
    Bessel factor would have left this script with two Bessel-corrected
    estimators and no canonical one, so the "cross-check against the published
    estimator" would have been checking the repo convention against itself.

    The two are NOT IDENTICAL FUNCTIONS.  Under a ZERO cash leg their outputs
    are related by the Bessel factor and nothing else:

        Delta_repo    = ddof_scale(T) * Delta_lw      (cash == 0),
        grad_repo[:4] = ddof_scale(T) * grad_lw       (cash == 0).

    Under a NONZERO cash leg their denominator definitions also differ -- repo
    divides by sd_ddof1 of the strategy return, lw by the population sd of the
    excess return -- so the zero-cash relation above does NOT carry over, and
    on this data the denominator term is the larger of the two and its sign is
    not fixed across markets.  Both statements are asserted as RELATIONSHIPS in
    the tests, never as equality.

    Note the distinction, which the wording above deliberately preserves: two
    functions being non-identical does NOT mean their numerical outputs can
    never coincide.  At Delta_lw == 0 the zero-cash relation gives Delta_repo
    == 0 as well, so the outputs do coincide there.  "Not identical" is a
    statement about the functions, not a claim that equality never occurs.

    Because the constant multiplies Delta_hat, Delta*, s(Delta_hat) and
    s(Delta*) alike, and every resample has the same length T, the studentized
    statistic and both p-values are invariant under multiplication by a
    POSITIVE NONZERO constant; only the reported Delta and interval endpoints
    move, by that same 6e-5 relative factor.  The positivity matters: at c == 0
    the studentized ratio is undefined, and a negative c would flip the sign of
    the signed studentized draws (the symmetric statistic uses |.| and would
    survive, the equal-tailed endpoints would not).  ddof_scale(T) > 0 for
    every T > 1, so the condition holds throughout this script.  That
    invariance is what makes it safe for the two estimators to carry different
    positive constants: they remain directly comparable on the studentized
    scale.

(b) Studentization.  The bootstrap statistic is the studentized/centered
    (Delta*_b - Delta_hat) / s(Delta*_b), NOT Delta*_b itself, and s(Delta*_b)
    is recomputed from each bootstrap sample (Ledoit-Wolf Eq. (6)/(8)).  On
    bootstrap samples the standard error uses their block-aware "natural"
    estimator of Section 3.2.2 (Goetze and Kuensch, 1996) rather than a kernel:
    with l = floor(T/b) complete blocks,

        zeta_j = b^(-1/2) sum_{t=1..b} y*_{(j-1)b+t}
        Psi_hat* = (1/l) sum_{j=1..l} zeta_j zeta_j'

    which for b = 1 reduces to the sample covariance of the bootstrap data, as
    their footnote 9 requires.  (Any common constant in s(Delta_hat) and
    s(Delta*) -- the T/(T-p) adjustment, the annualization sqrt(A) -- cancels
    from both the studentized statistic and the interval half-width.)

(c) The interval is the studentized bootstrap-t interval.  Primary is Ledoit
    and Wolf's own Eq. (7) SYMMETRIC interval, Delta_hat +- z*_{|.|,1-alpha}
    s(Delta_hat), where z*_{|.|,1-alpha} is the 1-alpha quantile of
    |Delta* - Delta_hat| / s(Delta*).  The equal-tailed bootstrap-t interval
    [Delta_hat - q_{1-alpha/2} s, Delta_hat - q_{alpha/2} s] over the SIGNED
    studentized draws is reported alongside it.  The two-sided p-value is
    their Eq. (9), PV = (#{d* >= d} + 1) / (M + 1) with d = |Delta_hat| /
    s(Delta_hat), which is the p-value dual of the symmetric interval.

(d) Time series bootstrap.  Primary is the CIRCULAR BLOCK BOOTSTRAP of Politis
    and Romano (1992) with fixed block size b, which is what Ledoit-Wolf
    Section 3.2.2 specifies (they prefer it to Kuensch's moving-block
    bootstrap because circular wrapping removes the edge effects that
    under-weight the first and last b-1 observations).  Blocks of ROWS are
    resampled from the joint (arm 1, arm 2, cash) matrix, so the pairing and
    the cross-arm dependence are preserved exactly, as in the earlier check.
    The STATIONARY BOOTSTRAP of Politis and Romano (1994) -- random
    Geometric(1/L) block lengths, which is what this repo's frozen inference
    contract uses -- is run as a robustness arm via the repo's existing
    `adaptive_jump.inference.stationary_bootstrap_indices`.  Caveat recorded
    honestly: Ledoit-Wolf define Psi_hat* only for fixed-length blocks, so on
    the stationary arm the same block-sum estimator is applied with pseudo-
    blocks of the EXPECTED length L while the realized blocks are
    Geometric(1/L). That arm is therefore an approximation and is reported as
    a robustness check, never as the primary interval.
    Ledoit-Wolf's data-driven block-size calibration (their Algorithm 3.1,
    a VAR(1)-based semiparametric simulation) is NOT run; instead the interval
    is reported across a fixed grid of block lengths, which answers the
    question actually asked here (does the qualitative reading move?) without
    a second layer of model choice.

The OLD plain-percentile moving-block bootstrap is re-run inside this script
on the identical return series, so old and new differ only in method, not in
data or in Monte Carlo seed provenance.
