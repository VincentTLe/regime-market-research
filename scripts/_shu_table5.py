WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The delay-1 column of Table 5 duplicates Table 4 and is
therefore IN sample. HELD_OUT below contains delays 5 and 10 only, and nothing
may add delay 1 to it.

WARNING — DELAYS 5 AND 10 ARE NO LONGER HELD OUT FOR ANYTHING DESCENDED FROM
THE v10 RESEAL. This docstring used to claim that "the delay-5 and delay-10
columns were never in any objective function", so that scoring a selected grid
here turned it into a testable prediction. That is false and was retracted by
docs/audit/heldout-delay-001-audit.md, which named this exact docstring as "the
load-bearing false statement". The evidence:

  scripts/experiments/probe_jm_grid_exhaustive2.pass_mask()  screens candidate grids
      directly against the Table-5 JM cells at delays 5 and 10, tolerance 0.05
  archive/scripts/audit/gate_v10_reseal.py:89-96               fails the reseal unless every
      delay-5 and delay-10 cell is inside 0.05 in every market

Any grid drawn from those searches is 18/18 inside this screen BY CONSTRUCTION,
so scoring it here is a selection statistic, not a prediction. Registry event:
heldout-delay-001 / PARTIALLY_RETRACTED_AFTER_AUDIT.

An honest held-out test needs an arm that was never screened on Table 5 — a
literature-named grid, for instance — and its own frozen question, written
before any such number is computed.

The caption states the protocol that makes the comparison fair, at line 979:
"A corresponding trading delay is also applied in the cross-validation when
selecting the optimal smoothing hyperparameter." The grid is held fixed; the
cross-validation is re-run at the delay being tested.
