# Summer 2026 Research Story

This file is the short human history of the project.

## 1. Rebuild the Shu-style Jump Model

The project started by trying to reproduce the regime-switching method and equity/cash results from Shu, Yu, and Mulvey.

Work completed:

- rebuilt market data from public sources;
- implemented the feature pipeline;
- implemented the fixed Jump Model walk-forward process;
- implemented monthly lambda selection;
- implemented the delayed equity/cash backtest with transaction costs (a signal
  at day `t` earns the return at `t+2`, at 10 basis points one way);
- compared results for the US, Germany, and Japan.

Main lesson:

> We have not been able to reproduce the paper exactly from the public
> information available to us.

Important missing or uncertain pieces include the original source data and some implementation choices such as the exact lambda grid and feature standardization details.

## 2. Try to improve the Jump Model

Several changes were tested, including simple challengers, adaptive switching penalties, confirmation rules, lagged evidence, and related controls.

Main lesson:

> No tested change is treated as a final result. Each experiment's outcome
> is recorded in the registry; several were retracted or corrected on audit.

Some variants changed regime behavior in interesting ways, but better-looking regime paths did not automatically produce better investment results.

## 3. Audit the foundation

Later checks found real problems in the research process and implementation.

Examples:

- a US index splice had deleted/misaligned one trading session;
- one holdout turnover calculation used the wrong scale;
- the German baseline grid-selection process was not clean;
- increasing the number of optimizer starts changed some grid conclusions;
- some tests looked stronger than they actually were;
- some earlier scientific claims had to be corrected or withdrawn.

Main lesson:

> Passing tests and producing sealed artifacts did not mean the research was scientifically settled.

## 4. Build too much research infrastructure

To prevent more mistakes, the repository accumulated contracts, hashes, registries, audit receipts, agent logs, and many tests.

This improved traceability, but it also created a new problem:

> The repository became difficult for the owner to understand.

By August, the project contained more process and historical machinery than a human needed for everyday research.

## 5. Current reset

As of 2026-08-28, the project is deliberately paused before any new model work.

The plan is:

1. understand and check the core pipeline, with the checking done by someone
   who did not build it;
2. inventory the important experiments already run;
3. decide which results are still trustworthy;
4. only then choose the paper question.

DA-JM and other new model ideas are parked for now.

## What counts as progress now

Progress is not another experiment, another audit document, or another AI-generated framework.

Progress means being able to answer, in plain language:

- What data are used?
- How are features computed?
- How does the Jump Model produce states?
- How is lambda chosen?
- How do states become equity/cash positions?
- Which past experiments are trustworthy?
- What repeated scientific question remains after the audit?
