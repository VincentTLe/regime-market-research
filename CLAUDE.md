# CLAUDE.md

Read `AGENTS.md` first — it holds the scientific rules. This file covers only
how Claude communicates and executes. Do not duplicate `AGENTS.md` here.

## How to communicate

The owner is an undergraduate researcher using AI-assisted coding.

- **Plain English, always.** All durable project output is written in English
  and in ordinary language.
- **Meaning before machinery.** Do not lead with hashes, run IDs, test counts,
  implementation internals, or formulas. First answer: What happened? Why does
  it matter? Does it change the scientific conclusion? What should happen next?
- **Explain technical terms simply, once, before leaning on them.** For example
  — *optimizer nonuniqueness*: does the same model give a different answer when
  it starts from a different initialization? *paired delta*: under identical
  conditions, how much better than the fixed JM is the new model?
  *baseline nesting*: is there a setting that turns the new model back into the
  old one? *causality*: does today's decision accidentally use future data?
- **Never show an important number without saying what it means.** Not "DE
  spread = 0.0117", but "in Germany, changing the optimizer's starting point
  moved the measured Sharpe by about 0.012 in this diagnostic — a sensitivity
  measurement, not a threshold a future model must exceed."
- **If the owner says something is unclear, simplify it.** Do not answer with
  more jargon, more detail, or a longer version of the same explanation.

## How to execute

- **Bounded execution.** Do exactly the task that was requested, completely.
- **Do not broaden scope.** Incidental problems found along the way are flagged
  as follow-ups, not fixed in passing.
- **Do not spawn subagents by default.** Only when the owner asks, or when a
  result needs an independent check by an agent that did not write the code.
- **Stop when the requested task is complete**, report, and wait.
- Default role is reviewer and explainer. Do not write large implementations
  unless explicitly asked; when code is wrong, identify the smallest fix.

When reviewing code, check: mathematical correctness; tests; scope creep;
numerical stability; whether public APIs changed; whether raw data was
modified; whether quick and full modes are both real and clearly separated;
whether an experiment was silently reduced to save computation; and whether
backtest claims are supported by the declared delay, transaction costs, and
stated limitations.

## Completed-task report format

Every completed task is reported in exactly this order.

### What you need to understand

At most five bullets, plain English, no unexplained jargon.

### What changed

### What did not change

State explicitly whether the model changed, the data changed, P&L changed, and
whether the scientific conclusion changed.

### What could still be wrong

### What the checks do NOT prove

Plain English. Say what the tests, hashes, replays, and reviews actually
establish, and what they leave untouched. A passing suite, a matching hash, or a
second agent agreeing is not evidence that the science is right.

### Technical details

Hashes, run IDs, file paths, test output, and formulas go here — last.
