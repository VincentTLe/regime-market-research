# Data provenance

Every canonical series below is rebuilt deterministically by
`scripts/data/build_external_sources.py` from sha256-pinned raw inputs in
`data/external/inputs/`, and every output hash is pinned again in the comparator
config — currently `configs/baselines/research-calibrated-reconstruction-v11.toml`.
Four of the five pinned hashes are unchanged since `research-expanding-v9-3.toml`
(now in `configs/baselines/legacy/`); the Japanese one changed on 2026-08-28,
when its dividend accruals were rebuilt without future information. The builder refuses to run if any input hash has moved.

## What the paper uses, and why we cannot

> [line 150-157] "The data analyzed in this article comprises the daily total return series of three major equity indices: S&P 500, DAX, and Nikkei 225, representing the US, Germany, and Japan, respectively. These data are sourced from the Bloomberg Terminal5 . For the risk-free rates, we use the 3-month Treasury Bill Yield from each corresponding country, sourced from the Global Financial Data (GFD) database. All data spans from the start of 1970 to the end of 2023."

Both sources are subscription products. Every series here is a free
reconstruction of one of them, and each is classified in the contract as
`documented_proxy_candidate` rather than a match.

## How early the data has to start

The paper says 1970, but 1970 is not a free choice — it is what the procedure
forces. Section 3.4.2 fits on a 3000-trading-day window and Section 3.4.3 adds
an 8-year validation window before the first out-of-sample day, so the series
must begin roughly twenty years before the reported period starts:

> [line 713-715] "Since our data begin in 1970, with training windows spanning 12 years and validation windows 8 years, the out-of-sample testing period begins in 1990."

A series that starts late therefore does not shorten the sample at the front —
it deletes the beginning of the reported 1990-2023 period. Required anchor is
about **1970-02**; all six of our series clear it by four to sixteen years.

| series | starts | vs the paper's 1970 | vs the required anchor |
|---|---|---|---|
| us equity (S&P 500 TR) | 1966-01-03 | +4.0 yr | +4.1 yr |
| us cash (DTB3) | 1954-01-04 | +16.0 yr | +16.1 yr |
| de equity (DAX) | 1965-01-04 | +5.0 yr | +5.1 yr |
| de cash (ladder) | 1965-01-01 | +5.0 yr | +5.1 yr |
| jp equity (N225 TR) | 1965-01-05 | +5.0 yr | +5.1 yr |
| jp cash (ladder) | 1965-01-01 | +5.0 yr | +5.1 yr |

The binding constraint is **not history length. It is total return.** Free daily
history is easy to find; free daily *total-return* history is not, and the paper
is explicit that it uses total-return series. **All three markets** need a
dividend reconstruction over part of the span. The US and German reconstructions
sit entirely inside the training window, so no *US or German* reconstructed
return is scored in the reported 1990-2023 period. They still reach that
period
indirectly, and this should not be read as isolation: they sit inside the
3000-day windows that fit the early-1990s models, and the expanding
standardizer keeps every past observation in its mean and standard deviation
permanently, so they help set the scale of every feature that is scored. They also spread each month's (US, Shiller) or
year's (Germany, JST) dividend figure across the sessions of that same month or
year, which is not causal within the period — but every scored decision is
dated 1990 or later, after all of those dividends and prices had occurred, so no
scored signal depends on information from after its own day. They are recorded
here, not changed. The Japanese reconstruction is different in kind, because it
is scored directly: our official N225TR mirror begins only
2011-12-19, so 1990-2011 of the *reported* period rests on a reconstruction. Its
accuracy was measured rather than assumed — on the v11 construction, in the
2026-07 audit: chained back 32 years it reached 6,470.24 against Nikkei's own
1979-12-28 base of 6,569.47, a drift of 0.048 pp/yr, and the reconstructed
2001-2011 era tracked MSCI Japan as closely as the official era does (0.9710
against 0.9678). The causal series that replaced it on 2026-08-28 differs from
that construction by at most 5.1e-5 per session in log return; these two checks
were not repeated on it.

## Equity

### United States — S&P 500 total return

| segment | source | note |
|---|---|---|
| 1988-01-04 onward | `^SP500TR`, the official S&P 500 Total Return index | used as published |
| 1966-01-03 .. 1988-01-03 | `^GSPC` price path + Shiller monthly dividends | reconstructed, chained onto the first official value |

- `^SP500TR` — https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ESP500TR/history/ (9,070 sessions)
- `^GSPC` — https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history/ (14,598 sessions from 1966)
- Shiller dividends — https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasets/s-and-p-500/main/data/data.csv

Validated by rebuilding 1988-2023 with the reconstruction recipe and comparing
against the official index it imitates, over their 9,070 shared sessions: daily
log-return correlation **0.999603**, annualised volatility off by **0.0027 pp**,
CAGR off by **0.0837 pp** (measured on the pinned local inputs on 2026-07-28;
the inputs are not published, so these three values cannot be re-derived from a
fresh checkout). What a fresh checkout can read is the gate:
`scripts/data/build_sp500_tr.py::validate` raises rather than returns if any of
its three thresholds fails.

**This series replaced the CRSP value-weighted total market on 2026-07-28.**
Substituting it removed the US HMM deviation: on 1987-10-19 the S&P 500 fell
20.47% and CRSP fell 17.41%, and with CRSP every 3000-day window containing that
day fitted a high-volatility regime about 8 pp below the values Figure 2 of the
paper publishes. That is a before/after comparison of one substitution, not a
proof that nothing else differed. See `docs/audit/2026-07-full-audit.md`.

### Germany — DAX performance index

| segment | source | note |
|---|---|---|
| 1987-12-30 onward | Stooq `^dax` DAX performance index | used as published (base 1000.0) |
| 1965-01-04 .. 1987-12-29 | Stooq `^dax` price path + JST Macrohistory annual German dividend yields | reconstructed, chained onto the 1987-12-30 base |

- Stooq `^dax` — https://stooq.com/q/d/?s=%5Edax (16,815 sessions from 1959-09-28)
- JST Macrohistory — https://www.macrohistory.net/database/
- Canonical file: `data/external/de_equity_tr_dividend_adjusted.csv`

> **Corrected 2026-08-06.** This section used to say "the DAX is a performance
> index, so dividends are already inside it and no reconstruction is needed".
> That was wrong and the repair predates this correction by more than a week.

The DAX is a performance index from its **1987-12-30 base date onward**, but the
vendor spliced the DAX *Kursindex* backcast — a price index — onto it before
that, so the pre-1988 segment carried **no dividends at all**. Both legs are
exactly 1000.0 on 1987-12-30, the official base date and value, which is why the
joint left no visible trace and why the omission survived so long.

The omission was worth **3.24%/yr** across eighteen years of training data. Two
separate signatures exposed it: the unrepaired series implies a German equity
premium of −3.96%/yr over the risk-free rate across 18 years, and the missing
yield matches two separate sources (OECD 3.02%, JST 3.24%). Repaired on
2026-07-28 by `scripts/data/build_de_total_return.py`, which writes nothing unless
three gates pass (reconstructed dividend rate +3.24% against the official era's
+3.02%; equity premium −0.60% against JST's +0.02%; daily volatility unmoved at
0.0042 pp). The repair is invisible to every published number being reproduced —
Table 4's German column lies entirely inside the untouched official segment —
and entered the pins from v9.2 onward (that config is no longer kept; v9.3 is
the oldest surviving legacy pin).

Yahoo's `^GDAXI` starts 1987-12-30 and is therefore **not usable on its own** —
it misses the entire training and validation history the procedure requires.
Cross-checks (measured in 2026-07 on the local inputs; only the 0.979 figure is
recorded in a tracked receipt): correlation 1.0000 against `^GDAXI` after 2000,
and monthly correlation 0.979-0.985 against the separate OECD MEI share-price
index before 1988. Known limitation: pre-Xetra fixings 1988-1999 differ from
Yahoo closes intraday (daily correlation 0.82-0.90) while monthly levels agree.

### Japan — Nikkei 225 total return

Two files are built from the same three inputs. The comparator reads the
causal one.

**`data/external/jp_equity_tr_causal.csv`** (sha256 `d263e8bf…`, read by
`configs/baselines/research-calibrated-reconstruction-v11.toml`):

| segment | source | note |
|---|---|---|
| 2022-06-01 onward | official Nikkei 225 Total Return × 1.006144 | official returns unchanged; one constant carries the level on from the bridge |
| 2020-07-10 .. 2022-05-31 | `^N225` price path + accrual realised over the 252 official sessions ending 2020-07-09 (0.02178 log/yr) | bridges the mirror hole using only data that existed on 2020-07-09 |
| 2011-12-19 .. 2020-07-09 | official Nikkei 225 Total Return | used as published |
| 1965 .. 2011-12-18 | `^N225` price path + the *prior* calendar year's JST dividend yield | reconstructed; level anchored at the first official value (a scale, not a return). JST's codebook defines `eq_dp[t] = dividend[t]/p[t]`, sourced for Japan 1952–2015 from Bureau of Statistics Japan tables 14-25-a/b (whole Tokyo exchange, not the Nikkei 225); year-end vs annual-average price not stated; see the 2026-08-28 receipt |

**`data/external/jp_equity_tr.csv`** (sha256 `e8717952…`, read by v11 and
earlier; kept so those sealed runs rebuild byte-identically). **Not causal**:
both of its reconstructed segments set a dividend accrual with a number from
after the day it applies to. That breaks AGENTS.md rule 1 for scored decisions
in 1990-2011 (by up to a year) and 2020-07..2022-05 (by up to two years). Found
by an external review of PR #30 (2026-08-27); corrected in registry row
`jp-causal-rebuild-001`.

| segment | source | note |
|---|---|---|
| 2011-12-19 onward | official Nikkei 225 Total Return | used as published |
| 2020-07-09 .. 2022-05-31 | `^N225` price path + accrual calibrated to the 2022-05-31 official value, spread backward | endpoint error 2e-16 — because the endpoint was used |
| 1965 .. 2011-12-18 | `^N225` price path + each year's own full-year JST dividend yield | reconstructed, anchored at the first official value |

The two series differ by at most 5.1e-5 in any session's log return (Japan's
daily return standard deviation over 1990-2023 is 0.0147); 5,861 of the 8,346
scored sessions change, and the annualised drift over 1990-2023 moves by
−0.028 pp/yr. How far that moves the fitted states and the strategy is
measured in `docs/audit/2026-08-28-jp-causal-rebuild-receipt.md`.

- Nikkei 225 TR — https://indexes.nikkei.co.jp/en/nkave/index/profile?idx=nk225tr
- `^N225` — https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EN225/history/ (14,508 sessions from 1965-01-05)
- JST Macrohistory — https://www.macrohistory.net/database/

Validated on the 2012-2023 overlap — on the v11 construction, in 2026-07: daily
return correlation **0.9977**, implied dividend yields within **0.3 pp** of the
JST series. Not repeated on the causal series (which differs from v11 by at most
5.1e-5 per session in log return).

Known limitation, and the reason the contract requests a 1969-05-01 start rather
than 1970-01-01: the Tokyo exchange traded Saturdays until January 1989 and our
`^N225` series contains no Saturday sessions, so a 3000-session window spans
about eighteen months more calendar time than the paper's. Starting literally at
1970-01-01 pushes the first out-of-sample day to 1990-09-17 in Japan and throws
away the first nine months of the reported period.

## Risk-free rates

The paper uses each country's 3-month Treasury bill yield from Global Financial
Data. Only the US has a free daily equivalent covering the whole span; Germany
and Japan need documented ladders, and those ladders are the largest remaining
data-side approximation in the study.

### United States — direct, no substitution

- `DTB3`, 3-month Treasury bill secondary market rate, discount basis —
  https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DTB3 — daily, from 1954-01-04.

Fetched live rather than stored, with a 1-day availability lag and a 10-day
staleness limit enforced by the pipeline.

### Germany — three segments, monthly

| span | series | source |
|---|---|---|
| .. 1975-06 | OECD MEI 3-month interbank rate | https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IR3TIB01DEM156N |
| 1975-07 .. 2007-08 | IMF IFS Germany Treasury bill rate | https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/INTGSTDEM193N |
| 2007-09 .. | ECB euro-area AAA 3-month spot yield | https://data.ecb.europa.eu/data/datasets/YC |

The IMF German bill series simply ends in 2007-08, which forces the third
segment. Splice quality measured on the 2004-2007 overlap: **-0.09 pp +- 0.18**.
The first segment is an interbank rate rather than a bill rate and carries a
credit spread, but it only touches the 1970-75 warm-up, never the reported
period.

### Japan — two segments, monthly

| span | series | source |
|---|---|---|
| .. 2017-06 | IMF IFS Japan Treasury bill rate | https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/INTGSTJPM193N |
| 2017-07 .. | BoJ 3-month uncollateralised call rate | https://www.stat-search.boj.or.jp/ |

The IMF Japanese bill series ends in 2017-06. Overlap agreement across 28 years:
correlation **0.986**, with the call rate averaging **+0.50 pp** above the bill
rate — a documented level caveat. In the negative-rate era the joint delta is
about zero, and Japanese short rates sit near zero throughout the affected span,
so the effect on the strategy is small.

Both ladders are monthly, held constant within the month, and made available to
the model with a two-month-start lag.

## What is irreducible

1. **Bloomberg's exact index vendor and close convention** for the three equity
   series. Bounded rather than closed: results are reported at trading delays of
   1, 5 and 10 days, and the delay-10 column shows how much a mis-timed close
   could matter.
2. **GFD's exact bill definitions** for Germany and Japan. Approximated by the
   ladders above, with every splice measured.
3. **The Japanese pre-2012 total return.** No free official series exists.
   Reconstructed and validated on a 12-year overlap.
4. **The German pre-1988 daily path.** The Stehle backcast has been checked
   against OECD monthly data; no independent *daily* source exists publicly.

## Refreshing the data: what actually works

Checked 2026-07-28, from this machine, after the morning's fetch had succeeded:

| host | result |
|---|---|
| `query1`/`query2.finance.yahoo.com/v8/finance/chart/...` | **429 Too Many Requests** — both hosts, caret encoded or not |
| `finance.yahoo.com/quote/<sym>/history/` | 404 to a plain client |
| `stooq.com/q/d/l/?s=...` | 200, but the body is a JavaScript proof-of-work challenge, not a CSV |
| `fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.csv?id=...` | timed out 2026-07-28; **200 on 2026-07-29**, 226,513 bytes in 2.9s |
| `raw.githubusercontent.com` (Shiller) | 200 |
| `data-api.ecb.europa.eu` | 200 |

So the Yahoo chart endpoint is open in the sense that it needs no login, but it
is rate-limited hard enough that it cannot be treated as a dependable feed, and
Stooq's CSV link now requires a real browser. That is why `stooq_dax_daily.csv`
is recorded in the contract as manually downloaded on 2026-07-25.

**None of this can break the replay of a sealed run.** (A new acquisition still
needs FRED to answer once.) Fetched inputs are stored under
`data/external/inputs/` with pinned hashes, and the one series the pipeline
still fetches live — `DTB3` — is captured into the run's acquisition manifest
(`data/raw/<config>-<timestamp>/us_cash.csv`) and verified against it rather
than re-downloaded. Every acquisition since v9.3 — including the two published
under `data/snapshots/` — holds DTB3 for 1969-05-01..2023-12-29, 14,262 data
rows, with the same sha256 (`62106f6d…`).

If a series ever does need refreshing, download it once in a browser, drop it in
`data/external/inputs/`, and update the `INPUT_SHA256` pin in
`scripts/data/build_external_sources.py`. The builder refuses to run on unpinned
bytes, which is the property that makes browser downloads acceptable here.


## The US bill rate, checked against an independent manual download

FRED refused this machine on 2026-07-28 and answered normally on 2026-07-29, so
the v9.3 bundle was acquired through the pipeline rather than by hand. The owner
separately downloaded the same series from a browser, which turns a convenience
into a real check: an automated fetch and a human one, made independently,
should agree byte for byte or one of them is wrong.

```
manual download            sha256 62106f6db8dcade6dc70bdd75ae89dc08720e6fdef7e012bb193aae7d8e74471
data/raw/shu-replication-expanding-v9-3-20260729T081133Z/us_cash.csv
                           sha256 62106f6db8dcade6dc70bdd75ae89dc08720e6fdef7e012bb193aae7d8e74471
```

Identical, so the manual copy was deleted rather than kept as a second source of
truth. The v9.3 raw folder named above is no longer on disk; the same bytes,
with the same hash, are tracked at
`data/snapshots/v11-ninit60/raw/shu-replication-calibrated-v11-20260808T073312Z/us_cash.csv`.

One note for anyone repeating the comparison. DTB3 carries **605 blank rows**
over 1969-2023 — US market holidays, the first three being 1969-05-30,
1969-07-04 and 1969-07-21. pandas reads those as NaN, and `(a == b).all()` is
therefore `False` on two byte-identical files. Use `a.equals(b)`, or compare the
hashes, which is what settles it here.

The exact request the pipeline makes:

```
